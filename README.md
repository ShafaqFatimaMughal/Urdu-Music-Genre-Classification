# Urdu Music Genre Classification
For our deep learning course project we opted to work on a deep learning model that classifies Urdu music genres using convolution neural netwroks. The input was given in the form of MFCCs. In this experiment, a set number of random 30 second segments of a song were used to generate MFFCs. Further details are given in the report PDF.

## Dataset 
The data set consists of 4 balanced genres that have 250 songs each. MFFCs were calculated for each song and stored in data.json, the file that is used in the code.
